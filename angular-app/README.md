# Angular scaffold â€” app-ecole (minimal)

This folder contains a minimal Angular scaffold to continue the MVP development. It's intended to be used after the prototype is validated.

How to run locally

1. From `angular-app` run:

```powershell
npm ci
npx ng serve --open
```

2. The app will open at `http://localhost:4200`.

Notes
- This is a minimal scaffold (files and routing) meant to be extended. You need Node.js + npm and internet access to install Angular packages.
- After the first run we will replace the placeholder Math component with the features converted from the prototype.
