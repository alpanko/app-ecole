# AI Assistant Instructions for app-ecole

## Project Overview
This is a new project that is currently being initialized. As the codebase grows, this document will be updated to include:

- Architecture and component overview
- Key development workflows
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Integration points and dependencies
- Critical implementation details

## Current Status
The repository has just been initialized and is ready for development. As code is added:

1. Document major architectural decisions and their rationale
2. Capture important development workflows and commands
3. Note project-specific conventions that differ from common practices
4. Detail integration points between components
5. Highlight patterns that require understanding multiple files

## Next Steps
Once the initial codebase is established:

1. Update this document with concrete examples from the code
2. Remove these placeholder sections
3. Focus on project-specific details rather than generic advice
4. Include links to key files that demonstrate important patterns

## Feedback
These instructions will evolve with the codebase. Developers should update this document when:

- Adding new major components or features
- Establishing coding patterns or conventions
- Creating new development workflows
- Adding external integrations

Please review and suggest improvements to keep these instructions accurate and helpful.
